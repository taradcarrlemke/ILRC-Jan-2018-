MIA FOD, DFOD, AFOD met with MDDOC Director and staff and discussed PEP and requested them to begin notifications. Meeting scheduled with Deputy Mayor that oversees Corrections and Police.  

10/05/2015 - We met with Miami-Dade County officials on Monday, October 5, 2015 to discuss implementation of the Priority Enforcement Program and the Miami-Dade County proclamation that creates significant constraints to the use of detainers and engagement with ICE.  For ICE the following personnel attended:

Marc J. Moore, FOD
B(6); B(7)C, DFOD
B(6); B(7)C, AFOD
B(6); B(7)C, OCC

The Miami-Dade attendees were:

B(6); B(7)C, Deputy Mayor
B(6); B(7)C, Executive Assistant to the Deputy Mayor
B(6); B(7)C, Director, Miami-Dade Police Department
B(6); B(7)C, Deputy Director, Miami-Dade Police Department
B(6); B(7)C, Director, Miami-Dade Department of Corrections
B(6); B(7)C, Assistant Director, Miami-Dade Department of Corrections
B(6); B(7)C, Miami-Dade County Attorneyâ€™s Office
B(6); B(7)C, Miami-Dade Department of Fire-Rescue

Everyone except for Deputy Mayor B(6); B(7)C had been involved in our prior discussions and presentations surrounding PEP and had familiarity with both the PEP and the current processes being followed by Miami-Dade to comply with the county proclamation issued by the commission.  We spoke in much greater detail on how we would hope that the I-247N could be utilized to allow us to take custody of an individual meeting the Priorities and the PEP guidelines at the time Miami-Dade County would be terminating their custody.  The representatives from the MDPD and the Department of Corrections saw no problems in using the 247N and making that notification call to ICE.  The county attorney opined that the proclamation was silent on the use of an notification process that did not involve the county maintaining custody past the point that their custodial interest would normally terminate and that doing so did not seem to him to violate any portion of the proclamation.  Deputy Mayor B(6); B(7)C was very supportive and asked about mid-meeting how quickly it could begin to which all the parties replied immediately. As the meeting progressed I could sense that Deputy Mayor B(6); B(7)C was considering how things might develop if this change was made immediately following the meeting.  He never wavered in his support and was very strong in his opinion that we all shared and rightly so the common goal of mitigating the release of convicted criminal offenders back into the community where they were removable from the United States.  He did have a concern that if the participants were to effect that change without providing some sort of dialog to the County Commissioners that they might interpret the change solely as an effort to skirt the proclamation that they had passed rather than definitive changes in ICE practices and tools not available at the time the proclamation was considered and developed as an effort to both more clearly focus on convicted serious criminal offenders while offering a moldable framework that could be implemented in a more customized fashion to address a state or local jurisdictions liability concerns with continued custody issues.

We also spoke about the presence of the U.S. Marshalâ€™s service IGA and our current authorization use that IGA with Miami-Dade County to detain individuals up to 72 hours where we could not immediately assume physical custody and compensate the County for the time an individual was detained under the IGA on ICEâ€™s behalf and that compensation would be at the rate provided for in the IGA.  There was reluctance at this juncture to pursue the utilization of this at least at the outset and I expressed my belief that while doing so would provide a benefit to us in some circumstances I was confident that we had sufficient resources  available to us in the greater Miami area such that we could take custody of those cases being released with an I-247N in place without any continued custody on their part past the point where their custody would normally have terminated if we could just agree that Miami-Dade would provide those notifications in concert with a filed I-247N.

We closed with Deputy Mayor B(6); B(7)C asking for an opportunity to engage either the Mayor and/or some of the members of the commission to gauge how receptive they might be to such a change without an actual presentation to the commissioners as a whole.  He did ask if ICE would be receptive to making a presentation to the Miami-Dade County Commissioners if needed and I told him we would be happy to do that.  Deputy Mayor B(6); B(7)C said he or his staff would be back in contact with us as soon as he could and that he would like this to move forward to a resolution as soon as possible.  It would seems that this point we are waiting for his office to reach back to us with those next steps.  It might be beneficial for someone at the ICE HQ or DHS level to contact Deputy Mayor B(6); B(7)C as a follow up to our very positive meeting both to again express our gratitude for the time he has taken to become directly involved and his current support of our mutual goals.  This would indirectly let him know the visibility that the current restrictions of the proclamation have within the Agency and the Department, convey our desire to support any efforts by his office and the Commissioners to amend it in a fashion that expands our ability to keep these convicted criminal offenders from release back to the street and our desire within the Agency and Department as a whole to apply the tools within PEP in the combinations best suited to both make it a comfortable proposition for Miami-Dade County and accomplish this end goal.  I certainly expressed that in our meeting but hearing it from an Agency head or the Department I believe could be beneficial as well.  The second portion would be for ERO and ICE to approve my attendance at an open Miami-Dade County Commissionerâ€™s meeting if requested or if the Agency would see a greater benefit to having that presentation made by someone from ICE HQ

10/15/2015 - The Field Office followed up this morning with the Deputy Mayorâ€™s Special Assistant. She relayed that Deputy Mayor B(6); B(7)C and the County Attorneyâ€™s office met with the Mayor.  He had some initial concerns at the outset of that meeting but once Deputy Mayor B(6); B(7)C and the Counselâ€™s office were able to fully brief him these seemed to be allayed and he was supportive of the use of the I-247N and agreed that it wouldnâ€™t be limited by the current proclamation nor would it seem that the proclamation required amendment.  Following this meeting Deputy mayor B(6); B(7)C office is working to  schedule a briefing with the commissioners (this may be preceded by individual briefings to select commissioners), who sponsored the original proclamation in order to brief them on our discussions and the proposed way forward. This will likely take place in the coming weeks.  The County still believes that until they have the support of the commissioners it is not prudent to make any substantive change.  We will touch base with them again, next week to determine how things are proceeding but at least at this point we appear to have garnered the support of the Mayorâ€™s office, Deputy Mayorâ€™s Office, Corrections Department, Miami Dade Police Department and the County Attorneyâ€™s office which is certainly very substantial progress.   

12/08/2015 - Miami Dade Corrections Assistant Director, B(6); B(7)C provided an update regarding the status of their possible participation in the Priority Enforcement Program. He indicates that the internal county meetings between the Miami-Dade Corrections Director and the County Commissioners to discuss PEP were postponed and are being rescheduled with a target completion date of before the new year. ERO/Miami will follow up with Miami-Dade on a weekly basis in an attempt to push their internal process along.

“By way of background, ICE formerly issued “detainer requests” asking that sheriff’s offices hold persons suspected of meeting federal “criminal alien” criteria for up to 48 hours past the time they were scheduled to be released from the county jail. In April 2014, a federal court within our 9th Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against this practice. The court held that holding people longer without a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution (Miranda-Olivares v. Clackamas County). This ruling made it clear that sheriffs honoring simple ICE detainers would be subject to liability and penalties.” …Sheriffs cannot enforce federal civil (non-criminal law). That’s why there are federal enforcement officers. Our sheriffs have more than enough to do in dealing with local and state laws in their communities.”
